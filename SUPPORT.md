# Support Policy

## Supported Platforms

Officially supported release targets:

- Linux x86_64
- Linux aarch64
- Windows x86_64

Best-effort release artifacts:

- macOS x86_64
- macOS aarch64

## Release Channels

Ragloom publishes artifacts through:

- GitHub Release binaries
- crates.io crate releases
- GHCR container images for Linux targets only

## Support Scope

The project treats Linux and Windows release targets as the formal support boundary for CI, release verification, and issue triage priority.

macOS binaries are provided as convenience artifacts. They should compile and publish when practical, but breakage on macOS does not block release unless maintainers explicitly promote it to a supported target.
